			<h4>Badjao are known as “Sea Gypsies” or ``Sea Nomads”. They are an ethnic  
			
			group found along the shores of Mindanao, Borneo, Celebes and Indonesia
			<br>
			A majority of the Badjaos practice Islam. They are recognized for their 
			<br>
			artistically-woven, colorful sails. The Badjaos lived in stilt-houses along the 
			
			coastlines. Originally they live off the sea by trading and fishing.
			
			The association was established with the purpose of becoming a model
			
			among the populace of the badjao community. The association started with 
			
			roughly 35 families. Now there are more than 500 members of the 
			
			community. The Badjao of Matina Aplaya has more than 700 individuals
			
			from 174 families. An estimate of 99 students are enrolled in Matina 
			
			Aplaya Elementary Schooling.</h4>
			<h1>About The Issue</h1>
			<br>
            <h4>As said on the Badjao Community, because of the lockdown amoang mga 
			
			miyembro nawala ang negosyo ug capital. gi baligya ilahang negosyo ug
			
            gipalit nalang pagkaon. Medicine such as paracetamol, pampurga, pang 
			
            bandage para sa samad ug first aid kit. Ang amoang mga istudyante 
			
			kinhanglan pud unta gadgets sama sa laptop kay magsugiod ang klase. 
			
			More of the problem in the Badjao Community is that after the high 
			
			tide in their place the garbage will spread everywhere in their place 
			
			making an unpleasant scenery. Lastly is that the badjao community's 
			
			finances are 50/50 since they can maintain their financial status 
			
			as they have such things as sari sari stores and more.</h4>

			<h4 style="text-align:center;">Jamil is a mild, easygoing and wide awake kind of guy, 
			<br>
			He loves being in loud places, traveling and having fun
			<br>
			but Jamil also loves quiet places, he loves being 
			<br>
			relaxed, to be precise he actually loves quiet places 
			<br>
			more than loud places because Jamil is a lazy guy and 
			<br>
			gets easily tired interacting with people. He loves 
			<br>
			helping his groupmates answer with the tasks 
			<br>
			especially when the task involves recording.
